# TE_capstone_Vendo-Matic800
I worked on this Tech Elevator project with fellow student Jamie Porche over the course of five days. We were tasked with writing a command-line application that uses File I/O to read at write data as part of our 14-week Java bootcamp.

This capstone marked the end of our second module. You can learn more about Tech Elevator's coding bootcamps here: https://www.techelevator.com/.

For full details about this assignment, please review the TEnmo project readme here: https://github.com/NoahBGriffin/TE_capstone_Vendo-Matic800/blob/main/java/README.md

There is of course still work to be done here and I plan to keep chipping away at it
